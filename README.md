# Intext-French-Suited-Deck-and-BlackJack-Simulator

This code, which runs on a system monitor, uses text instead of visuals to simulate a deck of French Suited playing cards. The functions include drawing a card, printing the discard pile, resetting the deck, and starting a game of blackjack. The game of blackjack is played with only two options: hit and stand. 

This simulator was created in 2023, when I was in 11th grade. My cohort had a liking for playing blackjack, whether it was during lunch or outings. However, without a deck, the game could not be played. Therefore, I thought it would be interesting to create a virtual version of the game.
